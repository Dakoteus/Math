# MATH
This is a directory of the coursework for interesting math courses that I took 
during undergrad college. I really enjoyed these courses and they gave me a completely
different view on mathematics.

# WARNING
I am NOT a perfect student. So, I did not get a perfect grade on these homeworks.
In some of these there are many errors and in some of these there are very few if not any.
Just be careful when you read, and challenge what I say (I did worse in abstract algebra). This will also make you understand
the problems better.
